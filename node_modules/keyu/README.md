**Keyu** (key utilities) provides **flexible** utilities to help you build **solid** projects <u>without repeating yourself</u>.
This library pretends to **fix** those **anoying things** that you find every day **when you write JavaScript**

The library helps you:

- Write functional programming code in javascript
- Combine sync and async functions easly
- Do safe conversions
- Check javascript types correctly
- Work with any kind of collection
- Apply complex concurrency patterns ([Rob Pike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6kdp27TYZs)).
